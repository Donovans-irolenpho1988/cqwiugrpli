Just finished watching The Wolf Man, and wow, that was a trip! A classic, yeah, but man, some of those effects are like... really? 😂 I mean, I know it's vintage and all, but there were moments I just couldn't keep a straight face, you know what I mean? Like, seriously, was that supposed to be scary?

Anyway, I gotta say, it's got that old horror charm. The foggy sets and dramatic music—yep, classic horror vibes all the way. It's kind of funny how much they get away with that suspense back in the day. All that howling and people freaking out—it’s kinda entertaining in its own way. But Larry Talbot, man, I feel for him. Imagine waking up to that revelation... that you’re the one wreaking havoc. Yikes. 🤯

> And the dialogue! Some of it's gold, unintentionally hilarious even. The way they keep explaining stuff to each other like the audience isn’t paying attention, lol, like Hey, don't forget he's a werewolf! We get it, thank you very much! 😂 

Downloading the movie was such a good call. I mean, grabbing a pillow and just watching the movie at home with some popcorn was perf. It’s one of those check it off the list kinda films, you know? Good to see where all these werewolf tropes started though. Full moon, the cursed bite, yada yada yada. Classic. 🐺

rray = dogs.map(dog => dog.name);

And can we just talk about that twist with his father and the cane? The irony, right? Love the campy flair. Anyway, I'm rambling now. Gotta chill a bit, clear my head—might even rewatch just for laughs. Catch you later!
